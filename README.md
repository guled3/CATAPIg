## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Running npm install will read the `package.json` file and install of the dependencies needed.

### Create a `.env` in the root directory
Create a file simply named .env 

You will probably have to do this in vscode because you cant name files just .env in windows without it.

.env
`APIKEY={PASTE YOUR CAT API KEY}`

### `npm run dev`
This will kick off the next compiling process and host a server at http://localhost:3000


### `npm run build`
Compile the project for production builds


### `npm run web`
Runs the compiled production build
